## Running Skiylia

### Obtaining Skiylia source

Clone the github repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SK1Y101/Skiylia.git
```

Navigate to the source folder and run

```bash
$ cd skiylia/src
$ python3 skiylia.py ...
```

Executing a skiylia file is easy, simply pass the filepath at the interpreter level!

```bash
$ python3 skiylia.py <file_path>.skiy
```

For extended information, the language additionally supplies a small help command

```bash
$ python3 skiylia.py -h
```

## Contributing

Any contributions made are absolutely welcome. Checkout the issues area for any outstanding problems, or to file your own!

Forking this repository is an excellent way to contribute to the code that makes this interpreter tick. Open a pull request (preferably to the develop branch) if you have anything to add, and it'll be looked over.

# Acknowledgements

I, [Jack](lloydwaltersj.com), definitely couldn't have created Skiylia without any outside sources.

I owe a huge debt to Bob Nystrom and his excellent book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Not only did he give me true inspiration to develop the first itteration of [Skiylia](https://github.com/Skiylia-Lang/PySkiylia), but also provided cleanly documented concepts and a delightful read. If there is *anyone* that hasn't yet read his implementation of Lox from cover to cover, I would thoroughly recommend doing so.
