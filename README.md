## Contributing

Any contributions made are absolutely welcome. Checkout the issues area for any outstanding problems, or to file your own!

Forking this repository is an excellent way to contribute to the code that makes this interpreter tick. Open a pull request (preferably to the develop branch) if you have anything to add, and it'll be looked over.

# Acknowledgements

I, [Jack](lloydwaltersj.com), definitely couldn't have created Skiylia without any outside sources.

I owe a huge debt to Bob Nystrom and his excellent book, [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). Not only did he give me true inspiration to develop the first itteration of [Skiylia](https://github.com/Skiylia-Lang/PySkiylia), but also provided cleanly documented concepts and a delightful read. If there is *anyone* that hasn't yet read his implementation of Lox from cover to cover, I would thoroughly recommend doing so.
