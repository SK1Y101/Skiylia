Variables
=========

Variables in Skiylia can be both dynamically and statically typed, as well as implicitly or explicitly defined

Declaration
~~~~~~~~~~~
Implicit Dynamic
    a = 5                                           Implicitly define a as 5
Explicit Dynamic
    var a = "hi"                                    Explicitly define a as "hi"
    var a                                           Explicitly define a as None
    (Technically this defines a as having the static "variable" type, which can hold any type.)
Explicit Static
    str a = "hi"                                    Explicitly define a as "hi", and unable to hold any type except str.
    int a = 5                                       Explicitly define a as 5, and unable to hold any type except int.
    float a = 4.5                                   Explicitly define a as 4.5, and unable to hold any type except float.
    frac a = 3/2                                    Explicitly define a as 3/2, and unable to hold any type except fractional.
    cplx a = 3+2j                                   Explicitly define a as 3+2j, and unable to hold any type except complex.
    stnd a = 3E+20                                  Explicitly define a as 3E+20, and unable to hold any type except standard notation.
    bin a = 0b10101                                 Explicitly define a as 0b10101, and unable to hold any type except bin.
    trn a = 0t0T1T0                                 Explicitly define a as 0t0T1T0, and unable to hold any type except ternary.
    oct a = 0o21457                                 Explicitly define a as 0o21457, and unable to hold any type except octal.
    hex a = 0x3E56B                                 Explicitly define a as 0x3E56B, and unable to hold any type except hexadecimal.

    Variables whose type is static are converted at declaration, raising an error if it's not possible to do so.
    ie:
    bin a = 56  -> 0b111000
    frac a = 3.8 -> 19/5
    int a = "3.0" -> 3

Type Promotion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    a -> var                                        Promote a to a dynamic Variable
    a -> int                                        Promote a to a static integer. If the conversion is not possible, raise an error
    a -> str : "hi"                                 Promote a to a string, if the conversion is not possible, set to "hi"
    a -> int -> bin                                 Promote a to an integer, and then again to a binary number.
        ie: a = 5.6      a -> int == 5      a -> bin == 0b101.1001100110      a -> int -> bin == 0b101


Control Flow
============

    if
    if-else
    if-elif-else
    while <condition>
    until <condition>
    do while <condition>                            Execute the loop body once before evaluating the condition
    do until <condition>                            Execute the loop body once before evaluating the condition
    for <var> in <itte>                             Itterate on the values in an itterable
    for <var> when <condition> do <inc op>          see: for (a; a <= 4; a=a+2) from JS
    for <var> until <condition> do <inc op>
