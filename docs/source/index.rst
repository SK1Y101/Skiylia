Skiylia
=======

**Skiylia** (/ˈskaɪˈliːə/) is a dynamically typed object oriented programming language; Skiylia is built from the group up to mirror the best features of python with sprinklings of C derivatives on top.

Skiylia was designed with some measure of portability in mind, as the skiylia bytecode compiler/interpreter is built from plain python3.10, any system that runs python can run Skiylia too! (which, in <current year> is basically every machine)
